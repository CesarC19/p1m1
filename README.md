The way to run this repository if they run it they must install flask,flask_sqlalchemy. You must also have an .env file with the following things
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID= "your client ID"
export SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET= "Your client secret"
export GENIUS_AUTH_TOKEN= "Your Auhtoization token"

Two problems I would address is the issue with not being able to use databases. If I had more time I would have used them.

One of the two issues I had was not being able to use databases. My workaround this was using a list to save usernames on the signup page and then searching through that list in the login page

The second of my issues was heroku not working for me. I was not able to get it working at times.
